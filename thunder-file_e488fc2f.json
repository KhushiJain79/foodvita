Stir continuously until they lightly brown and you get a roasted aroma.Once the lentils are roasted, we will add in the cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom pods, dry red chillies, fenugreek seeds and the coriander seeds. Turn the heat to low and roast well until the chillies begin to brown and you get a roasted aroma from the spices.Next will add in the poppy seeds and coconut. Continue to roast along with other ingredients for about a 30 to 40 seconds until the coconut loses its moisture. Once it is roasted we will add in the turmeric powder and the asafoetida powder. Stir until it combines well into the other ingredients. Turn off the heat and allow the mixture to cool completely.Once cooled add the ingredients to a spice blender and make a fine powder of the mixture. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and keep aside.Next thing to do, is to make the spicy vegetable tamarind sambar.For this, in a large pressure cooker, we will add the tamarind water, jaggery, the drumsticks, pearl onions, beans, carrots, bell peppers, tomatoes, salt and finally the bisi bele bhaat spice powder.Stir all the ingredients well. Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight and allow the vegetables to cook until you hear at least 2 whistles and turn off the heat.

After the soaking period, cook the chickpeas along with salt until very soft. If you press the chickpea between your fingers it should mash easily.To cook the chickpeas, place the chickpeas in the pressure cooker, add salt and 3-½ cups of water. Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight on and pressure cook until you hear 5 to 6 whistles. After 5 to 6 whistles, turn the heat to low the simmer for about 20 minutes. After 20 minutes of simmering, turn off the heat. Allow the pressure to release naturally. The chickpeas will continue to cook under the pressure that exists in the cooker. This will take another 15 minutes.Once the chickpeas are cooked through completely, drain the excess water. You can use the water in stocks or soups or even cooking rice.We will now begin to make the Vegetarian Shami Kebabs.Add the chickpeas into a food processor, along with the chaat masala, cumin powder, red chilli powder, fennel seeds, ginger, salt and mint leaves. Pulse until you have a coarse batter. Try to make a batter without adding any water.Transfer the chickpea batter to a mixing bowl; add the mashed potato, paneer and gram flour into the Shami Kebab Mixture.

After the soaking period, cook the chickpeas along with salt until very soft. If you press the chickpea between your fingers it should mash easily.To cook the chickpeas, place the chickpeas in the pressure cooker, add salt and 3-½ cups of water. Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight on and pressure cook until you hear 5 to 6 whistles. After 5 to 6 whistles, turn the heat to low the simmer for about 20 minutes. After 20 minutes of simmering, turn off the heat. Allow the pressure to release naturally. The chickpeas will continue to cook under the pressure that exists in the cooker. This will take another 15 minutes.Once the chickpeas are cooked through completely, drain the excess water. You can use the water in stocks or soups or even cooking rice.We will now begin to make the Vegetarian Shami Kebabs.Add the chickpeas into a food processor, along with the chaat masala, cumin powder, red chilli powder, fennel seeds, ginger, salt and mint leaves. Pulse until you have a coarse batter. Try to make a batter without adding any water.Transfer the chickpea batter to a mixing bowl; add the mashed potato, paneer and gram flour into the Shami Kebab Mixture.

Saute for a couple of minutes until they become lightly tender. Add the remaining ingredients, except the parsley and give it a good stir. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight on and cook until you hear 3 to 4 whistles. After 3 to 4 whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer the soup for another 5 to 10 minutes. After which, turn off the heat.Allow the pressure cooker to rest until the pressure releases naturally. The cooking process continues in the cooker as long as there is pressure inside it.Once the pressure is released, you can open the cooker and the soup will be ready.

Add 1 liter of water into the pot and bring it to a boil. Add 1 teaspoon of salt to the boiling water and turn off the heat.Next, to chop up the cauliflower, first remove the stem and leafy parts of the cauliflower and immerse it into the just-boiled, hot water. Allow the cauliflower sit for about 3 to 4 minutes. Then remove it from hot water, and place it on a kitchen towel. Pat it dry completely.Now grate the cauliflower completely and set it aside for a while. After about 10 minutes, cauliflower would have released a lot of water, squeeze it out and discard the water.Next, heat a pan and dry roast the grated cauliflower until it feels completely dry and contains no more moisture. While roasting it, take care not to cook it too much. It should not change to brown, so it is best to roast it on a low flame.Once the cauliflower is completely dry, take it off the heat, transfer it into a cool dish and allow it to come down to room temperature.Add the grated paneer to the cooled cauliflower. Add in the mashed potatoes, and all the spices along with corn flour. Knead well until everything is mixed. Make small lemon sized balls of the mix and arrange them on a plate. Set them aside till further use.Next, we need to fry the koftas. Warm some oil in a pan, when oil is hot enough, deep fry the koftas until evenly golden brown. For an oil-free version, you could also bake them in a pre-heated oven, or use a kuzhi-paniyaram pan to pan-fry them. Either way, lay the golden brown koftas onto kitchen paper once they are browned on all sides.To prepare the curry, first warm some oil or butter in a pan. Add the shahi jeera and fry for a minute. Next add the finely chopped onions and fry them till translucent. Add the tomato puree and cook it together until the puree thickens and begins to leave the sides of the pan.At this stage, add all the spice powders and mix well. Then add water as required and bring the curry to boil.Turn the heat down, add the cream, mix well and finally add the fried kofta balls.

To do this, sieve the all purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and sugar together to combine them.Add the curd and oil to it. Combine it with your fingers. Next add the lukewarm water a little bit at a time while kneading the flour together. Punch, press and pull the dough together kneading it continuously till it forms a firm, but soft dough.Knead well for a minimum of 5 to 7 minutes so that the dough is smooth. Apply a little bit of oil all over the dough and cover it with a wet towel. Set it aside in a warm place for 3 to 4 hours to rise a little bit. You can do this in a just-warmed oven, if you live in a cold place.In the meantime, prepare the stuffing for the kulcha. Mash the boiled and peeled potatoes, in a mixing bowl.Add salt, green chillies, coriander powder, cumin powder, grated ginger, chat masala, red chilli powder, garam masala, coriander leaves and mix well with your fingers till it is a evenly combined potato mixture.Now, to prepare the Aloo Kulchas, turn out the dough onto a work surface dusted with a little flour. Knead it for 3-4 minutes, then roll out the dough into a long cylinder and cut it into 8 individual portions.Rolle acc of the portions into a ball. Taking one ball at a time, flatten it out with your fingers to form a small disc about 3 inches in diameter. Take a spoonful of the spicy potato filling, place it in the centre of the disc.Bring the edges of the dic together into the centre and seal the filling inside to make a stuffed dough ball.Flatten it down slightly with your palm, and using a little flour for dusting, roll it out gently with a rolling pin to make a thin round about 5 inches in diameter. The kulcha will be slightly thicker than a usual chapati due to the stuffing. Take care not to let the stuffing ooze out of the kulcha.Next, wet your palms with a little water and pat one side of the kulcha with it. Sprinkle a pinch of ajwain seeds and chopped coriander leaves over it and press down so they stick to the kulcha.Warm a skillet or tava on a medium heat. When it is hot enough, place the kulcha on it, wet side down.Now, wet your palms again and pat the other side as the kulcha cooks on a medium heat. Sprinkle the reverse side with ajwain and chopped coriander as well.When little bubbles begin to form on the surface, flip the kulcha over to cook the other side. Repeat until both sides are browned evenly.When ou take the kulcha off the tava, liberally apply butter or ghee over it and stack them for serving.Repeat the procedure for the rest of the rounds made and all the kulcha are cooked.Serve hot along with Chole Pindi and a simple Mooli Raita or Salad for a quick wholesome lunch or dinner.\n","TranslatedInstructions":"To begin making the Aloo Kulcha Recipe first prepare the dough.
